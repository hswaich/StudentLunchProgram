            <h4>Use of Information Statement</h4>
            <p>
                “The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act requires the information on
                this application. You do not have to give the information, but if you do not submit
                all needed information, we cannot approve your child for free or reduced price
                meals. You must include the last four digits of the social security number of the
                adult household member who signs the application. The social security number
                is not required when you apply on behalf of a foster child or you list a
                Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for
                Needy Families (TANF) Program or Food Distribution Program on Indian
                Reservations (FDPIR) case number or other FDPIR identifier for your child or
                when you indicate that the adult household member signing the application does
                not have a social security number. We will use your information to determine if
                your child is eligible for free or reduced price meals, and for administration and
                enforcement of the lunch and breakfast programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may share your eligibility information with education, health, and nutrition
                programs to help them evaluate, fund, or determine benefits for their programs,
                auditors for program reviews, and law enforcement officials to help them look
                into violations of program rules.”

                the application is being made in connection with the receipt of Federal funds;
                School officials may verify the information on the application; and
                Deliberate misrepresentation of the information may subject the applicant to
                prosecution under State and Federal statutes.”
